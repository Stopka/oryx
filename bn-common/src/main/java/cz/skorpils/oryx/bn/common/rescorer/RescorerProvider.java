/**
 * <p>Implementations of this interface provide, optionally, objects that can be used to modify and influence
 * the results of:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@code ServerRecommender#recommend(String, int)}</li>
 *  <li>{@code ServerRecommender#recommendToMany(String[], int, boolean, Rescorer)}</li>
 *  <li>{@code ServerRecommender#recommendToAnonymous(String[], int, Rescorer)}</li>
 *  <li>{@code ServerRecommender#mostSimilarItems(String, int, PairRescorer)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is a means to inject business logic into the results of {@code ServerRecommender}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this class are factories. An implementation creates and configures an {@link Rescorer}
 * rescoring object and returns it for use in the context of one
 * {@code ServerRecommender#recommend(String, int, Rescorer)} method call. (A {@code Rescorer&lt;LongPair&gt;}
 * is used for {@code ServerRecommender#mostSimilarItems(String, int, PairRescorer)} since it operates on item ID
 * <em>pairs</em>, but is otherwise analogous.) The {@link Rescorer} then filters the candidates
 * recommendations or most similar items by item ID ({@link Rescorer#isFiltered(String)})
 * or modifies the scores of item candidates that are not filtered ({@link Rescorer#rescore(String, double)})
 * based on the item ID and original score.</p>
 *
 * <p>The factory methods, like {@link #getRecommendRescorer(String[], OryxRecommender, String...)}, take optional
 * {@code String} arguments. These are passed from the REST API, as a {@code String}, from URL parameter
 * {@code rescorerParams}. The implementation may need this information to initialize its rescoring
 * logic for the request.  For example, the argument may be the user's current location, used to filter
 * results by location.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example, a request containing {@code ...?rescorerParams=xxx,yyy,zzz} will result in an {@code args}
 * parameter with <em>one</em> elements, {@code xxx,yyy,zzz}. A request containing 
 * {@code ...?rescorerParams=xxx&...rescorerParams=yyy&...rescorerParams=zzz...} will result in an
 * {@code args} parameter with 3 elements, {@code xxx}, {@code yyy}, {@code zzz}.</p>
